    <h1>Tracking Urban Rails-to-trails Discourse on Reddit</h1>
    <h3>CP 8883 - Fall 2023, Final Project Report</h3>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
      Urban greenways present an exciting yet contentious movement within
      cities. Their advantages are evident: repurposing neglected spaces into
      versatile public assets, enhancing neighborhood connectivity, fostering
      economic growth, and advocating for healthier urban environments (Keith,
      2021). Still, local stakeholders highlight contributions to gentrification
      in nearby areas, alongside worries about increased crime rates and
      vandalism as well as property tax implications with rising housing values
      (Institute for Housing Studies, 2020). The involvement of local residents
      in the planning and implementation process remains a pivotal, yet often
      overlooked, aspect of this initiative's success, underscoring the need for
      inclusive planning and community engagement (Palardy, 2018).
    </p>

    <p>
      Social media has proven to be a community asset in sourcing public
      opinions on urban infrastructure (Gao, 2022). Reddit stands as a potential
      hub for diverse perspectives on the discourse surrounding urban greenways.
      This platform, characterized by a forum based structure and
      community-driven subreddits, offers a space where individuals actively
      engage in discussions. As users contribute to various conversations,
      sentiment can be examined through post titles and comments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using a social media platform like Reddit can contribute towards a
      data-driven approach for urban planners and policymakers. Social media
      platforms offer a unique opportunity to analyze trends, patterns and
      sentiments expressed in discussions on urban greenways that are difficult
      to capture through traditional surveys and public meetings. This method
      holds the potential to bring unique insights to the forefront while
      simultaneously contributing towards the democratization of the planning
      process for urban infrastructure. The potential of social media in shaping
      urban landscapes reflects a shift towards more participatory and inclusive
      urban governance.
    </p>

    <h2>Research Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      <span
        >In this research we wanted to investigate what discourse happens around
        urban rails-to-trails on Reddit, a social media platform. We wanted to
        know can a social media platform such as Reddit be a source of opinions
        in the discussion around urban greenways?</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>We approached the exploration through three concerns:</span>
    </p>

    <ol start="1">
      <li>
        <span><b>Investigating user characteristics:</b></span
        ><span
          >&nbsp;we were interested in identifying where users post the most,
          what are the characteristics of these users and are there any
          discernible patterns about user activity and their discourse on rails
          to trails.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span> <b>Tracing temporal sentiment trends: </b> </span
        ><span
          >We also wanted to explore how the online sentiment about
          rails-to-trails evolved over time, how that has impacted the online
          conversations and are there any regional patterns or place-based
          patterns.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span> <b>Identifying common themes and concerns: </b></span
        ><span
          >Finally we wanted to find common themes and concerns that users share
          on Reddit subcommunities about rail-to-trails, and how these concerns
          have evolved. Understanding recurring themes and concerns allows for a
          more nuanced view of what matters to the community, which can guide
          more effective and responsive planning decisions.</span
        >
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Scope of the study</h2>

    <p>
      This study selected four cities—New York, Chicago, Atlanta, and Detroit—to
      examine the urban phenomenon of transforming former rail lines into
      expansive, versatile urban greenways. While converted urban greenways
      exist in both urban and rural settings, our focus centered on the urban
      context. New York and Chicago feature completed linear greenways, widely
      discussed in urban planning circles. In contrast, Detroit and Atlanta
      feature partially completed yet fully operational greenways. Both
      completed and ongoing trails serve as focal points for discussions, with
      researchers delving into the effects of established greenways.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Urban Rails-to-trails in selected cities</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <h3>Scope of collection</h3>
    <p>
      The dataset was collected through a combination of city specific
      subreddits and searching for greenways in urban planning related
      subreddits. Using Python’s PRAW library, we first collected the posts in
      the 22 selected subreddits based on the 8 specified tags. We then
      collected all the comments on the threads to build a comprehensive
      dataset. We wanted to get both the posts as well the comments so that our
      dataset reflects the actual discourse on Reddit
    </p>

    <p>We tracked the following subreddits:</p>
    <div class="codeblock" style="width: 50%">
      <pre>
            <code>
                ["Atlanta","Chicago","Detroit","NYC","urbanism","chibike","fuckcars","urbanplanning","urbanism",
                "parks","nycbike","bikedetroit","micromobilitynyc","bicycling","bicycletouring","bikecommuting",
                "urbandesign","urbanstudies","urban","left_urbanism","strongtowns","YIMBY"]​
            </code>
            </pre>
    </div>

    <p>The following search tags were used:</p>
    <div class="codeblock" style="width: 50%">
      <pre>
                <code>
                    ["beltline","highline","606", "bloomingdale trail","Joe Louis Greenway", 
                    "dequindre cut","greenway", "greenways"]
                </code>
                </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      The tags are based on the names of the prominent rails-to-trails in the 4
      cities within the scope of our study, and also general greenway discourse
      within the selected subred
    </p>

    <h3>Data at a glance</h3>

    <p>Our final dataset after cleaning and processing included:</p>

    <h2>Where is the conversation happening?</h2>

    <figure>
      <img
        alt=""
        src="images/image24.png"
        style="
          display: inline;

          -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad) translateZ(0px);
        "
      />
    </figure>

    <p>
      A quick overview reveals that most of the conversations around the
      rail-to-trails happen in city specific subreddits. Suprisingly, in more
      generic urban related subbreddits, there is very limited discussion on
      either the 4 rails to trails or greenways.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img
        alt=""
        src="images/image13.png"
        style="
          display: inline;
          width: 100%;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          transform: rotate(0rad) translateZ(0px);
          -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad) translateZ(0px);
        "
      />
    </figure>
    <p>
      One more interesting observation is that the number of users discussing
      railts-to-trails are consistently increasing overtime. This includes users
      who have either created a post or commented on a post about
      rails-to-trails.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img
        alt=""
        src="images/image6.png"
        style="
          display: inline;
          width: 100%;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          transform: rotate(0rad) translateZ(0px);
          -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad) translateZ(0px);
        "
      />
    </figure>

    <p>
      Finally, we also analyze word networks find common co-occuring patterns in
      the discussion. The word networks reveal a few interesting patterns.
      First, the word networks reveal that the discussion around rails-to-trails
      is fragmented by specific rails-to-trails. For example, the word network
      for the Atlanta subreddit reveals that the discussion is fragmented by the
      Beltline. Secondly, we see that biking is a common theme across all the
      cities.
    </p>

    <h2>What are the user characteristics?</h2>
    <p>
      Using BERT and VADER, two Natural Language Processing models used for
      sentiment analysis, we conducted sentiment analysis on our dataset. BERT
      is a binary classifier that classifies text into positive and negative
      sentiment. VADER is a rule based model that classifies text into positive,
      negative and neutral sentiment giving sentiment scores. VADER is also
      specifically suited for social media text.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once we calculated the sentiment scores for both models, we then
      calculated the average sentiment by user to find distribution of the
      sentiment by user to get a sense of people discussing rails to trails.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        alt=""
        src="images/image10.png"
        style="
          display: inline;
          width: 100%;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          transform: rotate(0rad) translateZ(0px);
          -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad) translateZ(0px);
        "
      />
    </figure>

    <p>
      The distribution reveals that the average sentiment of the users skew
      slighlty positive, but a vast number of users have "neutral" sentiment. It
      is also worth nothing that there more extreme positives than extreme
      negatives.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img
        alt=""
        src="images/image19.png"
        style="
          display: inline;
          width: 100%;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          transform: rotate(0rad) translateZ(0px);
          -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad) translateZ(0px);
        "
      />
    </figure>

    <p>
      The initial findings of this study suggested that the majority of users
      engaging in discourse around urban greenways only post once. The average
      sentiment score of these single time users is neutral, demonstrating the
      idea that the sentiment spans from positive to negative but clusters in
      the center.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also find that the more number of threads the user is active in, either
      through comments or new posts, the more neutral they get. This is an
      interesting finding as it suggests that the more active users are more
      nuanced in their views. This could be mean that in order to temper extreme
      viewpoints about urban issues, it might be helpful to create spaces for
      more discourse.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, looking at the number of upvotes, it also illustrates that users who
      post more neutral views get the most "upvotes" instead of of more extreme
      views.
    </p>

    <h3>Visualizing the semantic structure of the discourse</h3>

    <p>
      To better get an understanding of how sentiment of a post might relate to
      the structure of threads, the distribution of sentiment within the
      structure we visualized a semnatic network of the threads.
    </p>

    <iframe src="senti_net1.html" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
    <p>
      For the purposes of legibility, we visualized only one specific year
      "2014".
    </p>

    <p>
      This network diagram dives into the structure of threads based on
      sentiment [<span style="color: #1b8fe1"> blue=positive,</span
      ><span style="color: #930112">red=negative</span> ], upvotes [size], and
      number of comments [nodes extending from center hub]. This particular
      network maps the 2014 sample of our dataset. In this network, the two
      largest center hubs are blue, again reinforcing the idea that threads with
      the most activity skew positive. The overall color of the network map
      leans neutral white to blue, again showing the volume of threads are
      neutral to positive. Still, there are standout threads with a more
      negative sentiment score and more upvotes.
    </p>

    <h2>
      How has the online sentiment around rails-to-trails evolved over time?
    </h2>

    <p>
      In this part, BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
      Transformers) Model are used to explore the sentiment of the Reddit thread
      data. This fine-tuned BERT model gives 1-5 star rating labels to our data
      based on the sentiments of the text, of which 1 star means extreme
      negative while 5 star means extreme positive.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bar plot below displays the distribution of sentiment ratings from
      2008 to 2023.We see an obviously growing number of comments by year with
      the presence of all sentiment ratings throughout the years, indicating a
      steady usage of the full range of sentiment. While extremely negative
      threads have increased in recent years, the scatter of points across each
      sentiment rating level is quite dense, reflecting the high volume of data
      and the widespread use of each sentiment category.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img
        alt=""
        src="images/image2.png"
        style="
          display: inline;
          width: 100%;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          transform: rotate(0rad) translateZ(0px);
          -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad) translateZ(0px);
        "
      />
    </figure>

    <p>
      Then we divided into the four cities, Atlanta, NYC, Detroit, and Chicago,
      to explore the sentiment trends from 2009 to 2023 across. In Atlanta,
      there's been a noticeable growth in sentiment expression, especially in
      positive sentiments (4 and 5 stars) in recent years.NYC's sentiment
      distribution appears more varied, with an increase in both 1-star and
      5-star ratings, suggesting a polarization in user sentiment. Detroit's
      chart reveals a modest rise in sentiment expression over time, with a
      recent uptick in 1-star ratings, possibly reflecting an increase in
      negative sentiment or specific local issues.Chicago shows a similar
      pattern to Atlanta, with a significant increase in positive sentiment
      expression, particularly in 5-star ratings.Across all cities, there's a
      trend toward more extreme sentiments (1 star and 5 stars) being expressed,
      while moderate sentiments (2 and 3 stars) remain less common.The data
      could indicate an overall increase in engagement on the platform and may
      reflect broader societal trends or local events influencing public
      sentiment.

          -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad) translateZ(0px);
        "
      />
    </figure>

    <p>
      In order to further explore whether the variation in sentiment relates to
      external events, we tried to identify some urban planning related events
      that took place in these four major cities from 2009 to 2023, labeled on
      the graph below. In addition, we marked the dividing line before and after
      COVID-19 Pandemic. Some coupling of these events and sentiment peaks was
      found, demonstrating that sentiment changes may be influenced by external
      public affairs events. The result was more evident in the curves for
      Atlanta, which will be a primary object of topic modeling
    </p>

    <h2>
      What are the topics of concerns and themes that are prevelant in
      "rails-to-trails" discussion online?
    </h2>
    <p>
      We wanted to get an insight into the contents of the discussions to get a
      sense of what were the common themes and concerns within our dataset. To
      analyze the text we did three different forms of analysis. We started by
      constructed word maps to “look inside”, creating a Co-occurrence heatmap,
      then conducted topic modeling to find the themes within the dataset.
    </p>

    <p>
      We've categorized the sentiments into negative (1 and 2 stars) and
      positive (4 and 5 stars) for clearer analysis.For each sentiment group, we
      created word clouds.In the positive word cloud, we see recurring terms
      like 'free,' 'design,' and 'connect,' which reflect the aspects users are
      happy about.The negative word cloud shows terms like 'cyclist' and
      'collision' more often, which may point to the specific issues or negative
      experiences discussed.

    <p>
      Looking at a plot of co-occuring words indicated there were a few topics
      that dominated the discourse, but there were no meaningful conclusions or
      insights we could draw from just the heatmap due to the diversity and size
      of our data set.
    </p>

    <h3>Topic Modeling</h3>

    <h4>Methodology</h4>

    <p>
      This study used topic modeling methods to extract the major themes and
      concerns in online discussions about urban greenways. Latent Dirichlet
      allocation (LDA) is a generative statistical model used in natural
      language processing to explain a set of observations through unobserved
      groups. LDA requires number of topics to be predefined. To find the
      optimal number of topics within our corpus, we started with n=2 (where n
      is number of topics) and went up till n=20. Through a mix of manually
      inspecting topics for each n and using topic cohesion measures, we settled
      on n=4
    </p>

    <p>
      The 4 topics that dominated the discourse were able to be related back to
      some of the initial public assets and concerns identified in the
      literature review. The descriptive name assigned to the four topics are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>placemaking</li>
      <li>multimodal transit</li>
      <li>economic development</li>
      <li>information posting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The names are based on manually inspecting the contents of each topic from
      the LDA distributions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following wordmaps illustrates the contents of each topic for a subset
      of meta dataset for the city of Atlanta.

    <h4>Findings</h4>
    <p>
      After arriving at the number of topics, we want to find the proportion of
      topics within the entire corpuse. We then used HDP to visualize the
      distribution of topics within the corpus.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img
        alt=""

        onclick="expandImage(this)"
      />
    </figure>

    <p>
      Once we had our number of topics, we also wanted to track the proportion
      of these topics in our corpus over the years. For that purpose we used
      Dynamic Topic Modeling (DTM) to track the four topics.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      Looking at the change in topic prevalence since 2008, we noticed that
      “placemaking” takes a dip right in the year 2020, while conversation
      around infrastructure and economic developments starts to take over the
      discourse. The year 2020 is also the beginning of the pandemic. We wanted
      to explore whether this trend holds for the four cities as well.

    <p>
      Looking at the change in topic prevalence over time in each of the four
      study cities, a similar pattern emerges. The placemaking topic dominates
      the conversation until 2020 when economic development and multimodal
      transit begin to take over the conversation. The repeated occurrence of
      social impact based topics beginning to share a larger proportion of the
      online discourse around 2020 suggests there is a connection with the
      Covid-19 pandemic. This idea emerges that large scale civic disruptions
      can influence the online discourse of major urban infrastructure.

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>
      The overall findings in this study can be summarized by the following
      list:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Volume: The online conversations around greenways have increased since
        2008.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pattern: The majority of users post only once, and post with an extreme
        position.
      </li>
      <li>
        Position: Users that are very active skew towards a more neutral and
        nuanced position.
      </li>
      <li>Skew: The volume of user activity skews positive.</li>
      <li>
        Topics: Discussions around greenways can be clustered into 4 general
        topics: multimodal transit, information posting, economic development,
        and placemaking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Covid impacted the discourse, economic and safety concerns, less general
        placemaking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Timing: Covid impacted the discourse, economic and safety concerns, less
        general placemaking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conversation: General discourse on greenways was popular at the
        beginning of our study, over time, specifically after covid, discourse
        on economic development and multimodal transit took over the
        conversation.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>
      To answer the three research concerns we started with, our results tell
      us:
    </h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The users tend to be slighlty more positive in their discussion about
        rails to trails online. Most users are occasional posters but and they
        are ones that tend to have the most extreme opninions. The more active
        users are more neutral in their sentiment and also receive most
        engagement. This trends holds for all cities in the study and is
        agnostic of subreddit.
      </li>

      <li>
        The absolute number of users posting online has increased and the
        sentiment tends to trend slighlty positive. The sentiment online seems
        to be impacted by real world events such as new developments, major
        milestones for a project or important events, but the effect needs to
        studied. What is clear is that online communities are a vibrant place
        that have diverse discourse.
      </li>

      <li>
        Using machine learning, we were able to identify four major themes in
        the discourse that were true for the entire corpus as well as the city
        specific data. These four topics were: placemaking, multimodal transit,
        economic development, information posting. While placemaking dominated
        the discourse historically, we have recently seen a surge in
        conversation around the multimodal transit, economic development and
        infrastructure. In all cities a major surge occured in year 2020, which
        is the year of pandemic signifying that the pandemic caused a major
        shift in the publics concerns about urban greenways and its impacts.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      This report delved into an exploration of Reddit threads related to “Rails
      to Trail” on sentiment analysis, user activity analysis, and topic
      analysis. While it provides significant insight into the patterns of
      users’ conversation and sentiments on Rails to Trail, there are certain
      limitations and suggestions for future study, which help outline the next
      steps in understanding the dynamic and nature of social media discourse.
    </p>

    <h3>Limitations:</h3>
    <p>
      Firstly, the Reddit user base does not reflect the general population,
      which limits the generalizability of our findings. Secondly, the VADER
      model used in this study is specifically used for social media but trained
      on twitter interactions, which may affect its accuracy and applicability
      to Reddit. Finally,the research had a limited scope in aligning the
      changing sentiment on Reddit with real-world events. This limitation
      restricts our understanding of how online sentiment reflects or reacts to
      external events.
    </p>

    <h3>Future Study:</h3>
    <p>
      The future research will consider expanding the timeline to include a
      broader range of real-world events. This would allow for a more
      comprehensive understanding of how sentiments on social media evolve over
      time. Besides, the user engagement dynamics will be considered to
      investigate whether new users are entering the conversation. Also, the
      impact of large scale civic events on online conversation will be
      analysed.
