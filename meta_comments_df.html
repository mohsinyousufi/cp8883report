      <td>From another article (https://roughdraftatlanta.com/2023/03/01/beltline-streetcar-expansion-is-moving-forward-despite-concerns-from-businesses-residents/):\n\n&gt;Fred Duncan, who lives near the Beltline, represents about 350 homeowners who live along the proposed route who oppose the project. The streetcar extension would cut through a historic area with narrow streets and disrupt the quality of life of these hundreds of homeowners, he said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“Atlanta is a car city,” he said. “The streetcar causes traffic backups now. Spending $230 million for 2.3 miles is a total waste of money. This project has been a huge albatross since its inception.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Julia Neighbors, a member of the Historic District Development Corporation, which owns Haugabrooks Funeral Home, said she lives on Randolph Street. She said MARTA’s community outreach has been “performative” to only reach a broad spectrum of the community impressed by the “sexy, vanity project.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Property owners along the route — those in the community directly   \nimpacted by the extension — have been largely left out of the   \nconversation, she said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Mike Greene, senior vice president of Portman Holdings, said his company has invested about $220 million to build the mixed-use office building Junction Krog District at 667 Auburn Ave. on the Eastside Trail and the purchase of about an acre of property across the street. The streetcar route is planned to run between the two sites.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“What attracted us to the Beltline, like other developers, is the  pedestrian activity and not necessarily that there would be transit there,” Greene said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“Most of us \[developers\] believed transit was pie in the sky,” he added, to audible gasps from some in the audience.\n\nMmm, the tears of unfathomable sadness</td>

We live in a city, and we need the infrastructure of a city. You can’t complain about traffic and then say “Atlanta is a car city.” If you don’t want traffic, don’t live in a big city. Atlanta quite honestly could support much more transit; the density is there for a robust light rail system at the LEAST (think something similar to the system they are building in [Seattle](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion)). It’s a damn shame we can’t do something like that here, and it’s because we delude ourselves into listening to people who believe inner city neighborhoods are suburbs.</td>

      <td>You can be against this without being a selfish fuckwit. I'm all for transit, don't like cars, and think transit should definitely connect to the Beltline. I'd be for this if I thought people would use it.\n\nThe route on the Beltline is going to have multiple pedestrian crosswalks and 3 stops within 1.3 miles. I imagine the top speed will be something like 25 mph with an average speed more like 10 mph. Electric scooters go that fast with far less footprint, environmental impact, cost, you don't have to wait 15 minutes between busses, etc. \n\nThe existing streetcar went 50% over budget and has average daily weekday ridership of only 300. Again, I love transit, but the existing streetcar has been a failure. I don't see the combined line, going from PCM to GSU, as fulfilling a need the city has. I could change my mind if I can see costs &amp; timelines for having transit around the entire Beltline.\n\nIf we're going to pave more land next to the Beltline, make a lane for faster users. Bikes, scooters, ebikes, one wheels, etc. The Beltline's biggest problem is its own success. Using it to commute sucks now.</td>

      <td>but tbh this is not a sustainable and promising way to conjure up regular everyday transit riders.  Events at stadiums are not an everyday occurance, nor is going to PCM, and nor is going to both in the same trip without other destinations in mind.  We should not be building transit to cater to occasional visitors and eventgoers who can finally take their trip from stadium to food hall.  We need to be connecting where people live and where people live.</td>

      <td>though i will concede that the quick surge of l.i.t rentals (e-bikes and scooters) over the past few years has indeed changed the mobility landscape, i do not agree that they compete with this *original* vision of a train corridor.\n\nmultiple options are great &amp; even necessary to counteract our embedded car culture, but i wonder if you're not forgetting about disabled, elderly and kids and anyone else who would/should be able to use the light rail.\n\nthe downtown streetcar is still in Phase One, with a steep learning/adoption curve and  plenty of hard lessons. its three biggest issues, imo:\n\n* it was not given exclusive right-of-way on city streets\n* it  wasn't marketed well as the first of several phases to transform our core city \n* it stopped expanding ~~slowly~~ so people (naturally?) think the early/current numbers can *easily* be used in arguments against it.\n\nthis first Beltline extension will address those issues in various ways and hopefully snowball into a complete 22-mi loop around central Atl.\n\nbuses can supplement  but they are no replacement for surface-level rail transit. (until Marta can prove it's capable of running true BRT, which it hasn't even tried yet despite pushing for it as a better substitute).\n\n*edit: minor rev. for clarity*</td>

      <td>I'm not complaining about the number of stops. I'm saying that this will compete with scooters, bikes and walking as people's options to move along the Beltline. Taking the train won't save meaningful time for that stretch. I imagine ridership would be comparable whether the train went all the way to PCM vs stopping at Irwin.\n\nThe top comment on this post is the only comment I see where someone is saying they personally want this service, and then only for special occasions. I just can't believe that this is Marta's best option for how to spend that much money.\n\nDoes anyone know why they're pushing this to be light rail instead of a bus? The current streetcar operation cost $90 million to build the infrastructure and get 4 trolleys. When they shut down the trolleys for 4 months for $7.5 million in repairs, they replaced them with vans. They could have always used the vans, made rides free forever, saved \~$95 million, retained the flexibility to change routes when needed, not messed up the streets for bikers, etc. The trolleys seem worse in every way.</td>

      <td>Actually it will. That section of the beltline has become something of a boardwalk. Trolleys are always dangerous unless they have separate  enclosed routes. (A trolley death was just announced in San Diego.)  The current design offers no real safeguards. The trolley was part of the original design and funding -- not anticipating the trail would be wildly popular with residents of Midtown or that Midtown occupancy would explode around it. The route (without dedicated right of way on Irwin St) will constantly be stuck in traffic. Use will be limited to tourists coming from downtown -- sponsored by bar owners --and a few people who live along the route. \n (The existing trolley has ridership levels that don't support its operation.) What I don't understand is who the people are on this sub and others so relentlessly in favor of the east side beltline trolley routes. Are they so opposed to Midtown residents that they want to ruin a good thing?  Are they bar and restaurant owners hoping for an infusion of tourists from downtown hotels? I just don't understand. We live on the other side of Piedmont Park and have used the Eastside trail since before it was officially opened. Implementing the trolley route plan simply ignores the current situation.</td>

It means transit can flow much more smoothly than if it was trying to cover the same general area on the road.\n\nNot to mention how the BeltLine *is* the front door for so much of the growth along the area, or at least a very busy secondary entrance. As others have said, the BeltLine has thousands of homes and jobs along it. All in dense, walkable, bikeable formats, which are exactly what you want for transit to be useful.</td>

      <td>right but how many of them would actually use the Streetcar? Especially considering how slow it runs on the existing section and just as slow on the future section.  Downtown Atlanta isn't drawing much office workers nowadays and few companies move there. GA state students are unlikely to live in Va-Hi/IP/O4W.\n\nAnd the whole "gotta start somewhere" doesn't hold water in Atlanta because this rail project is pretty much it for rail expansion in Atlanta.  There's literally no more money for anything else.  The sales tax is maxed out till 2040 and there is no other source of funds for expansion within the City. Hence the BRT treatment for every other corridor and those projects aren't totally assured.  That's why I'm skeptical of extending the streetcar, not because of NIMBY reasons but because it is literally has some of the worst ridership potentials in the region. 300 people rode the streetcar each day before it shut down for repairs.  Even if ridership optimistically triples despite barely doubling in length, we will have a transit line that attracts less than 1,000 riders a day.  I think this one-time shot we have with transit funds needs to go to a project that can generate at least 15,000 new transit riders every single day.</td>

      <td>But the reason the beltline was built was for this transit. So if you bought it thinking it was going to be your personal “backyard”oasis and now are concerned for transit in your area, the problem isn’t transit. It is that you were misinformed at the beginning. \n\nIts like buying a house across from a lot with a big “condos coming soon” sign because you like all the shops and restaurants built up to support the eventual condos, but being surprised when they build the condos.</td>

      <td>The BeltLine was literally designed and built for transit to operate separated from traffic. It's not 'dealing with', it's 'having access to', as has literally always been the plan. As I keep saying, I've *seen* the plans for trying to force a loop route to work using roads, and it just doesn't. The surface streets can not effectively replicate the path of the BeltLine, and even attempting to destroys the utility of the grade-separation that makes the BeltLine useful for transportation in the first place.\n\nIf you want green space without light rail, go to a park. The BeltLine is, and has always been, a transportation corridor first and foremost. Your desire to treat it as anything else does not change that reality.</td>

The entire point of transit on the BeltLine is that it's mostly all separated from cars on the street, and in a route that's not replicable by those same streets. It's a unique place that doesn't work for cars, but does work for transit, walking, and biking.\n\n&gt; carbon neutral corridor.\n\nLight rail is electric powered, and expands the way people can travel to &amp; from at the BeltLine in ways other than driving.

Even if that were to somehow come to fruition, is a net growth of 3,000 riders really the best use of our only shot at a rail project? Many conventional city bus routes around the country clear 3,000 riders per day post-pandemic easily with zero hard infrastructure.</td>

A system that included the full BeltLine loop, as well as many crosstown streetcar routes.\n\nJust as it would have been a travesty to not build out the full heavy rail system based on the first segment's ridership, so too would it be a travesty to kill off the larger future light rail network based on these first few segments.
